# Raspberry Pi Pico Gameboy

 This was a school project for an engineering class and a year long (required for graduation) Capstone project. This project does not adequately represent my currently abilities as a programmer, as it was developed under a limited time frame, and was made during a time when I had extremely different views as to the purpose and methodology of programming. This goes without saying, but for work that better represents my abilities, see more recent repostories of mine.

## Dependencies

- Pico SDK
